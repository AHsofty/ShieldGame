Thanks for playing my game.

You can play the game with either wasd or the arrow keys.
Press q to restart
press space to switch between auto mode and regular mode

NOTE:
you might need to change the game the enemy speed depending on your system because turtle is weird.
Just change the first line if you think the game is too fast/slow
